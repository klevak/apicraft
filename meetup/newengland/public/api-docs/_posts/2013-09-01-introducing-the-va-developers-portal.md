I needed to work with data from the VA, but I had so many projects to tackle, I needed to standardize how I'm working with the core data sources. I went to the existing VA developers portal and the web services section, and none it was acceptable for me to use in my projects.

The VA is only one agency I have projects, so I needed a standardized way to hange data and APIs within a portal that met my "building block" standards. I knew I wanted it to run on Github and be portable, so that anyone can use as a template for their own projects, in addition to me replicating as I needed for my projects.

The result of my work is this Developer @ VA portal, which I'm intending to use for my own projects, but also hopefully encourage others at the VA and beyond to build off my work.

This project is in a work in progress, and I hope to keep refining over my time in DC. Stay tuned and return often to keep up to date on the changes I'm making.
